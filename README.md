A working web application using C#.

This application is a simple MVC project which allows the user to create, view, edit and delete Employee records, storing the data in a local database.

This was built using ASP.net MVC5, with HTML5, CSS3, and bootstrap 3.7.

### Brief notes/observations

I am aware that there are some areas of this application which could be made better, but due to time constraints didn't get a chance to do. 

This application should cover all the requirements, but some areas I would look at if I had more time would be:
* More robust data validation for input fields
* Make PDF and Excel generation process more elegant
* Add 'Delete All' option for employee records
